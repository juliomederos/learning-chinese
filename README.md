** index.html

Web page that allows to practice vocabulary understanding and translation from Mandarin to Spanish (or other language if vocabulary.csv file is adapted to it).

The page shows a number of words / sentences from the vocabulary.csv file and combines it in two columns to show a quiz in order to match the columns to find the correct response.

Right now the correction is manually. The page / app shows the correct responses when the button "show/hide questions answers" or "show/hide questions answers corrected table" are clicked.
